HaHA: the Happy Humour Assistant chatbot that helps people learn to laugh.

To set up the chatbot, please navigate to the {add dir + README} directory and execute the commands listed in the README.
Once set up, you can run the chatbot by simply executing the following commands in seperate tabs from the {fast_run} directory:
$ ./running_SIHbot_backend.bash, 
$ ./running_SIHbot_frontend.bash

The humour detection model can be accessed from {add link}.
The models for emotion and empathy classification can be accessed from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19uh2aIyxqzS-4LiagBouu6YuPYiOvaDz?usp=sharing but they are not needed to run the bot as the scores are pre-computed.
