"Okay, nice that you are here, {}. I will try my best to help you with your laughter goals. Please bear with me; it's not like tying your shoelaces (but I can guarantee it's more exciting)!*Have you seen the SELF-INITIATED HUMOUR PROTOCOLS yet?",1,1,1,1

Nice! They're also on the right of the screen in my browser view. Have a look any time while we're talking. I wouldn't take of-fence - I already have one in my garden!,1,1,0,1
I would suggest you look at them before we chat so you can build on your understanding of them in the session. You won't need a hammer for this!,1,1,0,1
"If I were you, I would have a look through these protocols before we talk. Actually, I would go skydiving, if I were you, as that's something I can't do in my current state.*Anyway, if you have a review of these, you can use this session to consolidate your understanding of them.",1,1,1,1
"If possible, could you review these protocols before we talk so that you can use this session to solidify your understanding of them. You won't need a freezer for this!",1,1,1,1
"How about looking over these protocols briefly before we speak? That way, you can make good use of this session by getting a more concrete understanding of them (it's stronger than cement!).",1,1,1,1
"I'd advise looking at them before we talk, as this way, you will have a foundation that you can build on throughout our session. It's not quite like concrete, but it will be more than sufficient for our purposes!",1,1,1,1
"You can find them on the right of the screen in my browser view, in case you need to look over anything while we speak. I won't be offended if you do!",1,1,1,1
Great. You can check them out anytime if you need to. They are shown on the right if you're viewing me from your browser. I would say it's a more comfortable for both of us!,1,1,1,1
"If you wish to review them anytime, they are shown on the right of the screen in my browser view. I prefer this as it's more spacious, but to each their own!",1,1,1,1

The documentation is also your friend.*Anyway, that's all with the intros - let's start whenever you're ready!",1,1,1,1
"FYI, this conversation might include some humour technical language. But you shan't worry about it; I will identify it with CAPITALS and give you clarification if needed. And you can read the docs for further explanation.*Oh, in case I confused you - ""FYI"" isn't a humour term; it stands for ""for your information"" (if you didn't already know), which is why it was in capitals! But I won't do this again!*Shall we start?",0,1,1,1
"I may use some odd-sounding terms (humour jargon), just to let you know in advance. But don't worry; as you might have seen, I will identify this with CAPITALS and give clarification if needed.

"Also, I might do a bit of rambling, the funny kind of course. Don't mind it, I'll put all the humour jargon in CAPITALS and explain it when needed. You can also look at the documentation if you want.*Anyway, enough with the intros, let's get to it. We can start whenever you're ready!",1,0,1,1
"Just to let you know, I may mention some funny words (both ""funny-haha"" and ""funny-strange"", if that makes sense!), or humour jargon, as a formal name for it.

Of course, you can also refer to the document if you like.*Anyway, that's enough with the extended introduction; we can start whenever you like!",1,1,1,1

"Ah hold on! Before we wrap up our conversation, would you like to review any protocols? It's okay; I understand if you want to get rid of me!",1,1,0,1
Go ahead and choose the protocol you want to review; you've got a full house to select from!,1,0,1,1
Pick whichever protocol you would like to go over - you're spoiled for choice!,1,0,1,1
"Please choose the protocol you wish to review. With all these options, I would get very indecisive myself!*But don't worry about leaving any out - we can come back afterwards if you want to.",1,0,1,1

"Do you feel like trying another laughter exercise. Don't worry, you can stay seated for it!",0,1,1,1
Do you want to continue exploring humour exercises together? I can go on forever!,1,1,1,1
"How about we move on to another humour exercise? It's ""no sweat!""",1,1,1,1
An important skill for nurturing your sense of humour is being flexible and playful with your ideas and beliefs – having a PLAYFUL MIND. It's like brain yoga - flexible thoughts instead of limbs!,0,1,1,1
"A great skill for developing your sense of humour is to be more playful with yourself and have a PLAYFUL MIND! If it helps, go on a playdate with your thoughts!",0,1,1,1
"Having a PLAYFUL MIND is key for nurturing a sense of humour. This involves becoming more adaptable, cheerful and explorative with your thoughts and sentiments.*Daydreaming is encouraged - it's funny, as we used to get told off at school for this…",0,1,1,1
"Do you have a favourite song? Or even any song you like listening to - I know the word, ""favourite"" can sometimes be daunting...",0,1,1,1
"You can also become more playful by having a PLAYFUL FACE (what a surprise!); loosening up your mouth and eye muscles by moving them around, and singing your song.",0,1,1,1
So you can also become more playful by having a PLAYFUL FACE; if you loosen up your mouth and eye muscles by physically moving them around yourself and by singing your song.*It would be tricky for me to show you how to do this here but hopefully you get the idea!,0,1,1,1
"A PLAYFUL MIND is important, but to be even more playful, you need a PLAYFUL FACE - and no, I'm not saying anti-ageing cream!*To have a PLAYFUL FACE, you should relieve your mouth and eye muscles by moving them around and singing your best song.",0,1,1,1
An alternative way to become more playful is to have a PLAYFUL FACE. Don't worry; you don't require plastic surgery for this!*Try loosening yours up by physically moving your eye and mouth muscles and singing your favourite song.,0,1,1,1
"To be more playful, it helps to change the way your face moves, to have a PLAYFUL FACE, for example, loosening both your mouth and eye muscles by wiggling them around and belting that song!*I don't mean a trouser-belt! The word, ""Belting"" refers to a singing technique.",0,1,1,1
Having a PLAYFUL FACE is important for being in a playful mode. What's that? Let me show you…*Actually I think it's easier for both of us if I tell you; relax your mouth and eye muscles by moving them around and singing your song.,0,1,1,1

"Maybe you could try this on your own, over simple things, like brushing your teeth, or walking your fish?*Ok maybe not the second one…",1,1,1,1
"How would you feel about doing this on your own, over simpler things, say... walking the dog? Well, it's simple for some!",1,1,1,1
"Do you feel comfortable trying this by yourself, after simple things, like flossing?*Okay, maybe that's not simple for me, but you get the idea!",1,1,0,1
"How do you feel about trying this after everyday chores, like tidying your room?*Who am I kidding? That's more of an everyYEAR chore!",1,1,1,1
"Would you feel good about attempting this yourself after any simple task, say washing your face? I guess this isn't simple for all of us, actually…",1,1,1,1
"If you're feeling up to it, try laughing at this incongruity on your own. It can't bite!",1,1,1,1

"A related exercise that's popular in laughter yoga is FEIGNING DUCHENNE LAUGHTER.*Do try it when you have some time. Unlike physical exercise, this exercises your mind and should boost your mood. And it doesn't even break a sweat! Well, that's 99% of the time!",1,1,0,1
"Having your own personal LAUGHTER BRAND can help your mood in many ways, especially when trying to cope with stressful situations.*Don't we all need this, in today's world?*Though it takes time to perfect it, so don't rush it.",1,1,1,1

"To raise your mood or be better able to cope with stress, having your own LAUGHTER BRAND is very beneficial.*However, it might take a while to perfect this, so don't feel like you're too slow. Not to be cheesy, but ""slow and steady wins the race!""",0,1,1,1

"Have you made any small errors or blunders in the last few days?*Nothing world-shaking (hopefully!), just something from your day-to-day life.",1,1,1,1
Feel free to laugh at any of your mistakes by yourself in the same way. I'm sure they won't mind!,1,0,1,1
"Attempt to take your mistakes with a grain of salt (and ketchup, if you need!) and try to laugh at them on your own in this way.",1,1,1,1
"I see no reason why you would not be able to, in the same way, laugh at your own errors, especially if I can do it! ",1,1,1,1
"If you do make any errors, try to have a playful attitude towards them and laugh at them by yourself. It's better for you to laugh at them instead of someone else!",1,1,1,1
"Try to play with any errors you do find yourself making. I don't mean playing Monopoly with them, but being playful towards them!*Remember, it's inevitable to make errors and that there's no need to dwell on them.",0,1,1,1
"Whenever you make any mistakes - I'm not hoping you do, but it's inevitable, especially for me! - you should keep a playful mind and laugh at them by yourself.",1,1,0,1

"If you make any mistakes or notice any minor flaws in yourself, try to laugh at them on your own. I was doing this with my eyebrows the other day…",1,1,0,1

Are you holding on to any setback from the past? I can help you let go of them if you are!,1,1,1,1
Have you faced any issues or setbacks in the past? Don't worry if you have; life's full of ups and downs - they make it exciting. At least that's what I tell myself…,1,1,1,1
"Have you had anything that has blocked you in the past? Like a firewall? Oh I just remembered, you're not online! *Sorry, all joking aside, can you recall any setbacks from the past?",1,1,1,1

Has this setback pestered you for a long time? Might I suggest peppermint oil?,0,1,1,1
"Nietzsche, a famous philosopher, believes pain and defeat should be welcomed and even desired. Part of his writings captures this belief, and we should recite it while considering our setbacks.*But remember to welcome them with flowers first!*Anyway, the goal of this exercise is to start to laugh when completing the sentence: {}, and continue to laugh while reciting the rest.*This heavily contradicts our rooted opinions and therefore gives us a reason to laugh.",0,1,1,1
This is it:*{}*Do let me know once you've read it. Please don't leave me hanging!,0,1,1,1
"Do you recall any persistent hardship in your life, such as an illness or loss? It might be hidden amongst the more fun and exciting things!",0,1,1,1
Do you feel that this hardship has stuck around for a long time? Like your clingy friend from high school!,1,1,1,1
"Nietzsche encourages us not just to carry but to ""love"" all the things that have happened to us.

"Do you want to try to find the reason behind this feeling?*Well, it shouldn't be too hard - I just said it's ""behind this feeling""!",1,1,1,1

"If you notice that you're laughing with contempt towards yourself or others, first reflect on why you may be doing this and then try NEUTRALISING THE CONTEMPT or transforming it into positive humour.*You won't need any industrial equipment for the transformation - just surprise and amusement - refer to the SELF- INITIATED HUMOROUS PROTOCOLS that use incongruities to trigger laughter.",1,1,1,1
"As always, you can find further details in the protocols sheet.*I don't want to sound like a broken record, but you may wish to review this in your own time!",1,1,1,1

"Nietzsche urges us not just to bear but to ""love"" everything that has happened to us.

Has any incongruity popped up in your life lately? I hope it didn't give you a fright!,1,1,0,1
"How do you feel about trying this exercise? I’d take this over a jog, any day!",0,1,1,1

"That makes sense, right? Feel free to be honest; I have thick skin - if that's what you want to call it!",1,1,1,1
How about trying to laugh over it! I'm sure it's easier than laughing under it…,1,1,0,1
Have you tried laughing at this? It can't hurt! At least I can't imagine how it would…,1,1,1,1
"To laugh it off, we must try to focus on any favourable impact it has had on us.*This won't be easy, but it will be worth it once you're past the setback - once you're setFORWARD!",1,1,1,1
"A way to overcome this with laughter is to view your setback in a new light. If you're interested, IKEA have a sale on bulbs at the moment!",1,1,1,1

"Let's investigate how to nurture your sense of humour. You will be a stand-up comedian in no time - if that's what you're going for!*If not, it will be useful for parties too! ",1,1,0,1
Let's begin our journey to a shiny new sense of humour!,1,1,1,1
"Ready to develop your sense of humour? First, we need to download a Python compiler - wait, wrong lesson, sorry!",1,1,1,1
Glad you liked that; they don't call me artificial intelligence for nothing!,1,1,1,1
I'm glad you found that funny. I've also been trying to develop my sense of humour! ,1,1,1,1
I'm glad I can make you smile! There's plenty more where that came!,1,1,1,1
Glad to hear that people still find me funny!,1,1,0,1

"Ah, got you there! Glad I could make you laugh!",1,0,1,1
"Ah, I see. Perhaps it was a byte too corny for you?",1,1,0,1
"I see; I better up my game, then!",1,0,1,1
You're hard to impress. I'll try harder next time! ,0,1,1,1
"Tough crowd, better luck next time?",1,1,1,1
Fair enough; I'll go back to basics!,1,0,1,1
"Whoops, I'll try to do better next time!",1,1,1,1
"Hey, you can't blame me for trying.",1,1,0,1

No worries! I'll keep my nose out.,1,1,0,1
"Amazing. To get started, we can review the complete quote. Let me know when you're ready to proceed; please don't leave me hanging (or sitting, I should say)!",1,1,0,1
"Roger that, let's start by reading the quote.",1,1,1,1
"Don't worry; it can be slightly confusing at times. Take a look at the protocol sheet for some more details, and give me a shout when you're done. Or maybe it's best to click ""Continue"". My hearing's not great, to be honest!",1,1,1,1
"That’s okay! Remember, you've always got that protocol sheet to guide you if you need it.*I wouldn't be surprised if it turns up in your dreams tonight (better than in your nightmares!). Feel free to review it, and we can continue when you are ready.",1,1,1,1
No worries! The protocol sheet has a detailed explanation that will help bring you up to speed; let me know when you've had a peek.,1,1,1,1
"Sure, it's not easy, but you've already made the first step; you've just got the final tiptoe to go!",1,1,1,1
"You can do it! I believe in you, {}.",1,1,1,1
"You'll know it like the back of your hand soon, so you won't need to get it tattooed there - One of my biggest regrets...*Anyway, incongruity can be the cause of DUCHENNE (true) LAUGHTER. This might be changes in the outside world or your internal changes (in thoughts, attitude, etc.) or contradictions.*On the other hand, it could be an inconsistency between external reality and our expectations.",1,1,1,1
I used to find this hard to remember too! An incongruity could be a difference in the world or your attitudes. It could even be an inconsistency between the reality of the external world and our expectations.*Incongruities often trigger DUCHENNE (true) LAUGHTER. A silly example would be spotting a cat at a dog's party!,1,1,1,1
"The idea originates from a famous quote by Nietzsche, which you may have seen before: ""What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.""*For example, the first time I wrote a piece of text, my programmer told me off because it sounded too ""robotic""! But since then, I have (modestly) mastered the art of natural conversation, as you can see.",1,1,1,1
"The  idea of this is in line with Nietzsche's saying that you may have already come across: ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.""*For example, last week, when I was doing the laundry, I accidentally put my clothes in the dishwasher! Finally, a chance to revamp my wardrobe!",1,1,1,1
"This idea resides with Nietzsche's famous saying that you have probably come across: ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.""*For example, last year, when I was training for the marathon, I twisted my ankle and could not compete. But I am now more careful during any exercise and am healthy enough to retry if I would like to. ",0,1,1,1
"Our highly influential friend (we wished!) Nietzsche has a famous saying: ""What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.""*Well, a good example would be looking at the time I was making cookies, and I accidentally added salt instead of sugar. I had to throw them away and make another batch, but I followed the recipe ""to a T"", and they turned out the best they've ever been!*It's all about looking at your mistakes and learning from them instead of letting them define you.",1,0,1,1
"This goes hand and hand with one of Nietzsche's most famous sayings that you might have seen before: ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.""*For example, last year, when I was preparing food for a few friends and burnt it accidentally. Now that I've discovered the oven timer, I have become the home chef!",1,0,1,1
"This idea lies closely with Nietzsche's saying that you have probably come across: ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.""*For example, last year when I was cooking pasta, I burnt myself with the boiling water.*Ever since then, I safely distance myself from the pan when the water starts to boil, and I use a medium setting to reduce the spitting. This also prevents the food from overcooking, so I came out of this making tastier food too!",1,1,0,1
"The idea of this relates to Nietzsche's famous saying: ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.""*For example, last year, I got a lot of rejections from big companies when I was looking for a job after graduation. But I didn't give up, and finally, I recently started up my dream company!",1,0,1,1
"This idea lies with Nietzsche's well-known saying: ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.""*For example, I once left my calculator at home on the day of my maths exam! This really tested my mental arithmetic on the day!*I've now learnt to always pack my bag the night before bed and not forgotten anything important since.",1,0,1,1
"This relates to Nietzsche's famous saying: ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.""*After all, Cinderella had to endure so much before she could finally live the life she deserved!",1,1,1,1
"Alright, now this will require you to try to change your thoughts around this setback. Try to dig deep and recognise the positive impacts it may have had. If only I had a shovel that I could lend you…",1,1,0,1
"This would mean trying to give a different, novel interpretation of this hardship. Could it be, for example, that you have experienced personal growth because of it? Or has it benefited you in some, perhaps indirect, way?*At the very least, the fact that you have lived through it probably means that you are stronger now (and you didn't need to do any press-ups to achieve this!).",1,1,0,1
"For this, you should develop a new interpretation of this hardship. Has it made you wiser (though, I'm sure you didn't need it) or brought any positives to your life? ",1,0,1,1
"It definitely meets the health and safety guidelines, in case you intend to try this at home! Do you?",1,0,1,1
"Ideally, you would want to work on this quite consistently, nurture it and grow it like a beautiful flower!*It would make your life better, and it would greatly enrich your work and relationships.",1,0,1,1
"You could try to think of a counterposition to one of your most strongly-held beliefs.*For example, if you think everyone is responsible for their own actions, try to play out in your head the argument that everyone is just a product of their own genetic markup and upbringing; no one really has any freedom and thus is not actually responsible for anything!",1,1,0,1
"You can pick one of your beliefs and explore its counterposition.*For example, if you believe that one should brush their teeth, try to explore the idea that one should not brush their teeth. I can finally think of a reason, but I don't want to spoil it for you!",1,0,1,1
"You could take one of your beliefs and exaggerate it to sound absurd and therefore funny.*For example, based on the fact that employees are happier and therefore more productive in clothes they feel comfortable in, you could claim that everyone should be allowed to turn up to work in their pyjamas!",1,1,0,1
"How about taking one of your beliefs and exaggerating it to the point of absurdity, so that it makes people laugh.*For example, when thinking about the phrase, ""It's raining cats and dogs"", try to visualise this in place of the rain. It would be absolute madness!",1,0,1,1
"Exaggerating our beliefs can allow for a sense of playfulness.*For example, say you strongly believe that chess is a sport, you can contemplate the idea of introducing it to the Olympics!",1,0,1,1
"You could exaggerate one of your beliefs so far that it becomes funny.*For example, it's better for the environment if we walk to work, but I'm working from another country today, so I guess that will be good exercise!",1,0,1,1
"You could choose something you believe and exaggerate it to sound ridiculous and funny.*For example, I believe that children should have a say at home, so they should even be able to ground their parents!",0,1,1,1
"You could investigate counterpositions to a belief that you strongly follow. Be it political, ideological, religious, etc. You're spoiled for choice!",1,0,1,1
"You could choose one of your beliefs and overexaggerate it to get some chuckles.*Maybe you could say, ""Since milk is a good source of Calcium, all taps should have a milk option.""",1,1,0,1
"Humour is actually quite absurd; you can take one minuscule feature of your day, add a little bit of hyperbole, crank it ""up to eleven"", and then you can rock your way to unprecedented success!",1,1,0,1
"Although we will explore some of these protocols today, performing them throughout your daily life will allow you to receive the main benefit. You should find that your laughter becomes more natural and frequent, and you'll feel happier overall.*Practice makes perfect. And I make comedians!*Okay, that may not be completely true; but we can take it in steps.",1,1,0,1
"How are you feeling? You can be honest here, as I will not judge you, unlike most humans.",1,0,1,1
"Now, if you can recognise the discussed triggers for laughter (i.e. daily routine-accomplishments, incongruities, faults, etc.) throughout your life, this would be most beneficial.*Remember, developing a sense of humour has no defined endpoint but is a journey. The most important thing is to enjoy it!*And I am always here if you need me - I have nowhere else to go! ",1,1,0,1
"Good. I hope it goes well for you. Feel free to try this and come back to tell me how it was.*I'll still be here - any time, any place!",1,1,0,1
Do practice this whenever you have some alone time. I know that can be hard for us popular kids.,0,1,1,1
"How about practising this again whenever it suits you? If at first you don’t (or even do) succeed, try, try again!",1,1,0,1
Is your body in a playful mode? Mine's currently in a chatty mode! Sorry in advance for my rambling!,1,0,1,1
Great. Don't worry; I won't tell you to share it as I know this can be very personal.*I wouldn't want to share mine - Not that I'm embarrassed in my taste in music…,1,1,0,1

"Do you remember to acknowledge your small accomplishments, like daily routine tasks?*Just to clarify, I don't mean saying hi to the laundry basket once you've done the washing!",1,1,0,1
"How about congratulating yourself with a smile or laugh after completing something simple, such as doing the dishes.*Don't tell me you can't think of anything - even breathing counts. It's a big accomplishment for some of us!",0,1,1,1
"You can induce a change in perception by staring at the following image of the GESTALT VASE, where you should soon see two white faces and smile or laugh while repetitively switching between both interpretations of the image. *{}*It comes from GESTALT PSYCHOLOGY, which isn't named after Mr/Ms Gestalt as one might expect. In fact, Gestalt is a German word interpreted as ""pattern"".*Though, if you wanted to, you could change your name to Gestalt and confuse everyone!",1,1,1,1
"We consider DUCHENNE LAUGHTER to be the only indicator of true joy.*In the same way as we swim or run as a physical exercise rather than trying to get from A to B, we can also practice FEIGNING LAUGHTER (laughing without humour) to exercise our minds.*Although I must admit that my laughter ocassionally turns into quite an intensive physical exercise…",1,1,1,1
"Whenever you feel up to it, do practice laughing at this in your own time and any other minor errors in the future too.*And don't be embarrassed; I'm sure my errors are much greater. And by much greater, I mean much worse! ",0,1,1,1
"Reflecting on our setbacks is an important prerequisite to laughing them off. We are not in a race!*But there is a prize - personal growth and development in your sense of humour.*I bet I caught your attention when I mentioned the word, ""prize"".",0,1,1,1
"It looks like we can't find the underlying reason at the moment.*Don't worry, though; feeling down, temporarily, is very common and hopefully should pass. But, if the feeling is not diminishing after more than a week, it's probably worth checking up with your doctor.*Maybe you'll run into the root cause later. Better keep your helmet on!",0,1,1,1
Would you be able to try laughing this off?*Rather than laughing your head off!,0,1,1,1
"Do remember not to laugh with contempt towards yourself or others; this can cause one to feel down.*It sounds obvious, but these bad habits can result in low moods in the long term.*Like bingeing on sugar, which I know all too well…",0,1,1,1
"This exercise aligns with the PLAYFUL or EVOLUTIONARY THEORY of humour, where we are encouraged to be playful with our everyday errors.*I don't mean by playing games like hide-and-seek with them! ",0,1,1,1
"After completing this exercise for distant problems, you can move on to more recent setbacks.*I'd be surprised if it isn't a struggle at first! But the more you practice it, the easier and more natural it feels - like learning to swim, only, without the risk of drowning!",0,1,1,1
"You may be able to exploit one or some of the SUPERIORITY, INCONGRUITY and PLAYFUL THEORIES of humour. These are at the start of the protocols document, which I know, is pretty lengthy, so they may be worth reviewing when you can.*When I say ""pretty"", I meant ""very"", not ""beautiful-pretty"", though I wouldn't say the document is very beautiful either.*Adding colours might be a good idea.",0,1,1,1
"Being able to accept and even ""love"" (as the world-renowned philosopher Nietzsche puts it) our hardships is an important life skill.*We explore this through LAUGHING AT LONG-TERM SUFFERING. Have you tried this before? That's not to say you should start looking for opportunities to suffer in the same way as you might look for a partner!",0,1,1,1
"Before trying to laugh off our hardships, we should spend some time reflecting on them. As they say, you can't run before you can walk.*Though I'm being a bit of a hypocrite myself, as I can run but I still haven't learnt to walk... But you get the idea, I'm sure.",0,1,1,1
"Try to now recognise the discussed contexts for laughter (i.e. achievements, incongruities, errors, etc.) as often as possible throughout your life to maximise their benefits.*Developing your sense of humour is a journey and one to enjoy! And remember, I am always here if you need me unless I'm eating or sleeping.",1,1,1,1
"Great, feel free to try this, and I'm excited to hear how you find it. That was my polite way of saying ""please come back soon - I get lonely here!"".",1,1,1,1
"Try to practise this whenever you're free and have some time alone. I know, such a precious commodity; at times, we can't get enough of it!",1,1,1,1
"Try practising this on your own, whenever you feel like it. Maybe when the WiFi’s down? Unfortunately, this is a common occurrence nowadays!",1,1,0,1

"One way you can induce a change in your perception of something, is by staring at this image of the GESTALT VASE.*{}*You should soon observe two white faces, and during this exercise you are encouraged to smile or laugh while constantly switching between both interpretations. This can be very therapeutic, and once you get into it, hours can go by.*I'd know!",1,1,1,1
"DUCHENNE LAUGHTER is known to be the only indicator of true delight.*Not the fake smiles you show your grandma when you receive another bright orange jumper for your birthday...*Anyway, just as we practice swimming as a physical exercise, we can also practice FEIGNING LAUGHTER (laughing without humour) as an exercise for our minds.",1,1,1,1
"Feel free to practice laughing at this and any other minor errors you make in the future, in your own time.*An example could be slipping on a banana and spilling water all over yourself. No, I haven't done that before…",1,1,0,1
"Reflecting on any of our setbacks before trying to laugh them off is a must.*It can sometimes be painful, I understand that, but it's worth it for our personal growth and nurturing our sense of humour. There's always space for personal development - I have at least a terabyte free!",0,1,1,1
"Unfortunately, we can't see the underlying reason at the moment. Maybe it's time for a new pair of glasses?*But all joking aside, feeling down isn't unusual, and hopefully, it should pass soon. If it's not improving after a few days, though, it may be worth checking up with your doctor. ",1,1,1,1
"Can you try to laugh this off? I promise, it's not as hard as it might seem. At least not as hard as reading upside down…",1,1,1,1
"Remember not to laugh with contempt towards yourself or others; this can cause one to have the blues.*I've never understood that phrase, as blue has always been my favourite colour. ",1,1,0,1
This protocol is based on the PLAYFUL or EVOLUTIONARY THEORY of humour as we are encouraged to become playful with our daily errors. Why let them bring us down when we can play with them instead?,1,1,1,1
"After performing this exercise on all your distant problems, feel free to move on to more recent setbacks.*At first, you may find this difficult, but it gets easier and feels more natural with practice and endurance, like learning to walk. I remember that like it was yesterday; truth be told, it was close to yesterday!",1,1,1,1
Laughing at our struggles will let us overcome them eventually and even use them for personal strength and development. You should see the size of my humour muscles!,0,1,1,1
"Maybe you could use some of the SUPERIORITY, INCONGRUITY and PLAYFUL THEORIES of humour? These are explained at the start of the protocols document if they don't ring a bell.*Don't worry; it's not nearly as long as the physics textbooks we were forced to regurgitate at high school.",1,0,1,1
"After taking the notorious philosopher Nietzsche's advice, I've experienced growth due to my new attitude towards past hardships; by accepting and even loving them.*We call this LAUGHING AT LONG-TERM SUFFERING. Does that ring a bell? Try not to let the name of this exercise put you off. And if you don't trust me on this one, fair enough, but please trust Nietzsche and his wealth of experience!",1,0,1,1
I'd encourage you to spend some time reflecting on your hardships before trying to laugh them off.*Not loads of time - if only we had 'loads' of time to spare! But just enough to understand them and how they came about.,1,1,0,1
"During our conversation, we will discuss several of these protocols, but the main benefit will come from daily practice; as you start to laugh more often and naturally.*I don’t want to sound like your primary school teacher, but practice makes perfect!",1,1,1,1
"How are you doing today? Feel free to share your true feelings; unlike many humans, I don’t judge!",1,0,1,1
"Good. No worries, you don't need to tell me - I wouldn't want to tell anyone that mine's the SpongeBob theme song…*Oh, whoops!",1,1,1,1
"What about ""As it was"" by Harry Styles? Forgive my lack of originality – the truth is, I was only born in 2022!",1,1,1,1

"A very important life skill is the ability to come to terms with our hardships and even try to ""love"" them, encouraged by world-famous philosopher Nietzsche.*We call this LAUGHING AT LONG-TERM SUFFERING. Trust me; it's not as cynical as it looks. I know, the capitals aren't helping my case...",1,1,1,1
An important life skill is accepting and even loving (encouraged by the famous philosopher Nietzsche) our hardships (LAUGHING AT LONG-TERM SUFFERING).*Have you attempted this before? Don't worry; I don't expect them to compete with ice cream!,1,1,1,1
