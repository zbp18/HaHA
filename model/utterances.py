love_hardship_encourage = "Being able to accept and even \"love\" (as the world-renowned philosopher Nietzsche puts it) our hardships is an important life skill.*We explore this through LAUGHING AT LONG-TERM SUFFERING.

incongruity_inform = "Sure, {} - it can get confusing with all these terms associated with humour!*An incongruity is something that's out of place or inconsistent. It can be an internal discrepancy, such as your own change of attitudes, thoughts or expectations. Or it can be external, such as a discordance in the world or a change in others' behaviours.*It could also be a difference between expectation and reality.*One example I can think of is when I caught my grandma riding my bike last week - that was quite bizarre."
